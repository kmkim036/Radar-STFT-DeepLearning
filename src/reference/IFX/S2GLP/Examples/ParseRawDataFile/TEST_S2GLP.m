% DESCRIPTION:
%
% This examples shows the Doppler processing for the collected raw
% data and computation of the target.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% NOTES:
%
% For Doppler modulation there is no FMCWEndpoint in the XML file, the
% range FFT has to be omitted and the Doppler FFT has to be directly computed.
